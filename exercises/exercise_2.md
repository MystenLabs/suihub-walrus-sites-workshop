# Exercise 2

Modify the website's resources and include metadata for the Sui explorers.

Most probably, the site you have just uploaded shows up in the Sui explorers and wallets like this. These are the default metadata.

You have to find a way to make it look like [this](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0x14e8decaa365aea73f7e9493e4a825fed8fa1a92f3d84817961e2c52c26e53f4/tx-blocks).
Note that the metadata include a custom name of the project, a description, an image for the thumbnail etc.
