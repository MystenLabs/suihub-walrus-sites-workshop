# Exercise 3

Host your own testnet portal and browse your site using the base36 version of the site object id.

i.e. you should be able to browse a site like this: http://1gf4k008v1zmrl4wri9bndyb3i4od4dqn27mz9dwu0bwzrw9m6.localhost:3000/ 

> The above link is just an example. Most likely it won't work, it's just a test upload I made when preparing the slides.

The link to the portal docs is this: https://docs.wal.app/walrus-sites/portal.html
