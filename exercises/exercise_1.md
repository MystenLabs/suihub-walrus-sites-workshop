# Exercise 1

Deploy your first website on testnet and connect it with a [SuiNS](https://testnet.suins.io/) domain.

> ℹ️ Tip: Use the [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) tool to get a quick overview of the commands you need to run. e.g. `tldr sui` or `tldr sui client`.

1. Make sure that you have installed the [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) and have a [Sui wallet set up](https://docs.sui.io/references/cli/keytool#generate-a-new-key-pair-and-store-it-in-a-file).
2. Get some SUI tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.sui.io/).
3. Make sure that you have installed the [Walrus CLI](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html#installation).
4. Get some WAL tokens from the faucet.
5. Choose a website to publish. You can upload something yours (e.g. your personal website, blog, portfolio), or use one of the [example-walrus-sites](https://github.com/MystenLabs/example-walrus-sites) repo. 
6. Create a SuiNS domain for your website and bind it to your website (tip: use your site-object id).
