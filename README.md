# Sui Hub Walrus Sites Presentation

The slides of the presentation that took place at SuiHub are actually a Walrus Site! 

Here you can find:

1. The source code for them (in the `app/` directory).
2. The exercises and their solutions (in the `exercises/` directory).

> ⚠️ It is recommended to go through the exercises first before checking the solutions, even if you don't manage to solve them.
When putting some initial effort, the information is more likely to be retained.
